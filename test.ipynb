I am currently finishing a masterâ€™s degree in AI and Business Analytics. I started exploring computers and programming at a young age and eventually enrolled in a computer science degree.\\n\\nOnce there, I figured I did not quite like the degree and ended up studying French literature and mathematics at the University of Lille, in France. Excellent decision.\\n\\nAfter graduating, I had the impression that I had been in the university world for too long. So I wanted to get a feel of a real-world industry and maybe create a business. That is how I got enrolled in a business and finance programme at Toulouse Business School. During that time, I also started developing software again and got a job at a media agency as a software developer, where I learned a lot.\\n\\nI am currently working as a software developer in France and I publish youtube videos and articles about software development and machine learning.\\n\\nKaggle Notebooks>\\n\\nKaggle Notebooks\\n#\\n\\nHere are a few Kaggle notebooks explaining some machine learning models.\\n\\nIntroduction to GMM: Fraud Detection\\n\\nPredicting Cancer with Logistic Regression', metadata={'source': 'https://alejandro-ao.com/about/'})]"
